# arduino-nextion-simulation
This is a tutorial for you to do simulation between your arduino microcontroller and nextion editor. In this case we dont need to have an LCD to test our code.

## What you need
1.  Nextion Editor Application https://nextion.tech/nextion-editor/
2.  Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software (tested on windows 11 version 1.8.19)
3.  Any microcontroller (in this case ESP32)
